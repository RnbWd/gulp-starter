Gulp Starter
=========

I almost about this, it's been 11 months. I *think* it dedupes react from the browserify bundle, pre-renders a static index.html template, async loads react before calling `react.render`, and uses the immutable, observable object store from `mercury`.

`indexer` in `gulp-config` is now an npm module [file-indexer](https://www.npmjs.com/file-indexer)

`immutablejs` exists, it was a pipe dream back then

everyone uses webpack now :triumph:

should have written a blog post on this a year ago..
